👋 Hi, I’m @Salamint !
I am a developer of the Asilux project, a Minecraft Server project,
and I also work on open sources or private personnal projects.

My favourites languages are Python 🐍, Java ☕,
and I am currently learning new languages
such as C/C++, C# and maybe a day I could learn Javascript.

For now, my projects are personnal and I don't want to show them right now.
